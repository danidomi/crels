## Installation

To install, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danidomi/crels/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After the installation process is complete, make sure to add it to your bash, by default it does the following:

```shell
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

## Commands

After installation, you can use `crels` to manage your C project's releases. Run `crels` with the desired command
and optional arguments:

### usage

The usage command shows what are the possible commands in `crels`.

```shell
crels
```

### clean

The clean command removes object files and cached files generated by the build process.

```shell
crels clean
```

### release

The release command releases C dependencies for your project. You can specify the release by providing an `os`(operating
system) and architecture, or you can simply run the command to release all listed in the c.rels file.

#### release a specific package

```shell
crels release <os> <arch>
```

To release your project use `crels` simply by running the following command:

```shell
crels release
```

`crels` will look for a `"c.rels"` file in your project directory, releases for the specified in the file.

#### release from "c.rels" file

You can create a `"c.rels"` file to define your project's releases. The file should contain a list of releases
in the following format:

```shell
<os> <arch>
```

Here's an example `"c.rels"` file:

``` 
Linux aarch64
Linux armv7l
Linux x86_64
```

In this example, we've defined releases for the `"Linux"` operating system with different
architectures: `"aarch64"`, `"armv7l"`, and `"x86_64"`.

The `crels` tool will use these to create the releases for each.

### version

The version command prints the version of `crels` installed.

```shell
crels version
```
